## Description
The project is a traffic light to facilitate road-crossing for pedestrians. This project consists of 2 Modes:  

### In Cars mode:
▪ Cars' LEDs will be changed every five seconds starting from Green then yellow then red then Green again.    
▪ The Yellow LED will blink for five seconds before moving to Green or Red LEDs.  
▪ LCD will display the mode “Cars “.  

### In Pedestrian mode:
▪ Change from Cars mode to Pedestrian mode when the pedestrian button is pressed.     
▪ If pressed when the cars' Red LED is on, the pedestrian's BlueLED and the cars' Red LEDs will be on for five seconds and LCD will display “Pedestrian”, this   means that pedestrians can 
cross the street while the pedestrian's Blue LED is on.  
▪ If pressed when the cars' Green LED is on then Yellow LEDwill start blinking for five seconds while keeping “cars” on LCD, then the cars' Red LED and pedestrian   Blue LED are on 
for five seconds and LCD will display “Pedestrian”, this means that pedestrian must wait until the Blue LED is on.  
▪ If pressed when the cars' Yellow LED is blinking, then Yellow LED will keep blinking for five seconds while keeping “cars”     
on LCD, then the cars' Red LED and pedestrian Blue LED are on for five seconds and LCD will display “Pedestrian”.
